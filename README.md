## Notes

All these implementations are to help me learn the algorithms - they don't form any kind of library or tutorial.
Just putting them in the public domain in case they're useful to anyone else also studying from this book.

## Chapter 1: Neighborhood Methods

Run neighborhood-pearson-cosine.py

```
python neighborhood-pearson-cosine.py
```

This calculates the missing item 1 for user 3 from table 2.1 in the book. It can also be used to solve exercises 1 and 2 if you change the matrix and the item requested in main().
